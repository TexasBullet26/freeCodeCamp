## Basic HTML and HTML5: *Create a Bulleted Unordered List*

#### **Explanation:**

HTML has a special element for creating `unordered lists`, or bullet point-style lists.

Unordered lists start with a `<ul>` element. Then they contain some number of `<li>` elements.

For example:
``` html
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
```
would create a bullet point-style list of "milk" and "cheese".

#### **Challenge:**

Remove the last two `p` elements and create an unordered list of three things that cats love at the bottom of the page.

#### **Test Needed to Be Met:**

1. Create a `ul` element.

2. You should have three `li` elements within your `ul` element.

3. Make sure your `ul` element has a closing tag.

4. Make sure your `li` elements have closing tags.
