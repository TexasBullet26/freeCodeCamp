#### **Explanation:**

You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action on your `form` element.

For example:
``` html
<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>
```

#### **Challenge:**

Nest your text field in a `form` element. Add the `action="/submit-cat-photo"` attribute to this form element.

#### **Tests Needed to Be Met:**

1. Nest your text input element within a `form` element.

2. Make sure your `form` has an `action` attribute which is set to `/submit-cat-photo`.

3. Make sure your `form` element has well-formed open and close tags.
