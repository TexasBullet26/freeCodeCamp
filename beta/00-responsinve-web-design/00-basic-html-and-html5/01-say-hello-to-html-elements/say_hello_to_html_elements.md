## Basic HTML and HTML5: *Say Hello to HTML Elements*
From freeCodeCamp's Basic HTML and HTML5 "Say Hello to HTML Elements"
[freeCodeCamp - Say Hello to HTML Elements](https://beta.freecodecamp.org/en/challenges/basic-html-and-html5/say-hello-to-html-elements)

#### **Explanation:**
Do you see the code in your text editor that says `<h1>Hello</h1>`? That's an HTML `element`.

Most HTML elements have an `opening tag` and a `closing tag`.

Opening tags look like this:
``` html
<h1>
```
Closing tags look like this:
``` html
</h1>
```
The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.
#### Challenge:
To pass the test on this challenge, change your `h1` element's text to say "Hello World".
