#### **Explanation:**

Now let's change the color of some of our text.

We can do this by changing the `style` of your `h2` element.

The style that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the "color" style.

Here's how you would set your `h2` element's text color to blue:
``` html
<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```
Note that it is a good practice to end inline `style` declarations with a `;`.

#### **Challenge:**

Change your `h2` element's style so that its text color is red.

#### **Tests to Needed to Be Met:**

1. Your `h2` element should be red.

2. Your `style` declaration should end with a `;`.
