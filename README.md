## **FreeCodeCamp**
 freeCodeCamp is a fairly large community that helps you learn to code with a hands on experience. They have tons of resources for you to learn how to code including challenges/projects in the following:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Algorithms
- jQuery
- JSON APIs
- Ajax
- Bootstrap
- Sass
- React
- D3
- Node.js
- Express.js

- and much more with their beta program

 You can also get your hands dirty by contributing to open source projects by nonprofit organizations.
#### **Purpose for Repository**
